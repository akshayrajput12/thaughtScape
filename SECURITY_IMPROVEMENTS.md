# Security and Performance Improvements

This document outlines the security and performance improvements made to the CampusCash application.

## 1. User Data Security

### Sanitized Logging

We've implemented a comprehensive logging system that:

- Only logs in development mode using `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'`
- Sanitizes all user data before logging
- Masks sensitive fields like IDs, emails, and personal information
- Uses typed interfaces for sanitized data

### Key Files:

- `src/utils/sanitizeData.ts`: Contains utility functions for sanitizing user data
- `safeLog()`: Only logs in development mode
- `safeErrorLog()`: Logs errors with sanitized data
- `sanitizeProfileForLogging()`: Sanitizes profile data
- `sanitizeUserForLogs()`: Sanitizes user authentication data
- `sanitizeAuthStateForLogs()`: Sanitizes auth state changes

## 2. Profile Data Management

### Centralized Profile Context

We've implemented a centralized profile context that:

- Fetches the user profile only once after login
- Caches the profile data for reuse across components
- Provides real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
- Ensures counts are never negative

### Key Files:

- `src/contexts/ProfileContext.tsx`: Provides profile data to all components
- `useProfile()`: Custom hook for accessing profile data

## 3. Database Improvements

### Non-Negative Counts

We've added a database trigger to ensure counts are never negative:

- `src/db/migrations/fix_negative_counts.sql`: SQL migration to add the trigger
- Updates existing negative counts to zero
- Prevents future negative counts

## 4. Component Optimizations

### Reduced Profile Fetching

- Removed duplicate profile fetching in multiple components
- Components now use the centralized profile context
- Reduced database queries and improved performance

### Updated Components:

- `src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- `src/components/auth/AdminRoute.tsx`
- `src/components/Navigation.tsx`
- `src/components/UserNav.tsx`

## 5. How to Apply Database Changes

To apply the database trigger for preventing negative counts:

1. Connect to your Supabase database using the SQL Editor
2. Run the SQL script in `src/db/migrations/fix_negative_counts.sql`
3. Verify that any existing negative counts have been updated to zero

## 6. Testing

After applying these changes, you should:

1. Test authentication flows to ensure they work correctly
2. Verify that profile data is displayed correctly across the application
3. Check that following/unfollowing users doesn't result in negative counts
4. Ensure admin access is properly restricted
5. Verify that console logs don't contain sensitive information in production
